        <h1>Chamber Ambassadors</h1>
        <p>Chamber Ambassadors are a special group of people who volunteer their time to help promote the Greater Lexington business community and support
            Chamber functions. Ambassadors are usually the most outgoing, pro-active employees in their company. They project a positive image for the
            company they represent as well as for the Chamber. Ambassadors perform a wide variety of duties in the Chamber, but their main function is
            to help promote the Chamber, welcome new members to the Chamber and make Chamber events successful and enjoyable for all.</p>
        <h2>Why become a Chamber Ambassador? </h2>
        <p>Being a Chamber Ambassador puts you and your business in the spotlight! Ribbon cutting photos are printed on the Chamber’s website and the weekly
            e-newsletter, which is read by nearly 2,000 individuals. They are also hosted on the Chamber’s Web site which receives thousands of hits each
            month. That gives your company free publicity as a supporter of new businesses coming to the community.</p>
        <p>Ribbon cuttings and other Chamber events also provide a great opportunity for networking and a few minutes of fun with other leaders in the community.
            Remember, Chamber Ambassadors are often the first community representatives a new business owner meets, so it’s the perfect opportunity to
            make new business connections.</p> {module_contentholder name="CONTENT - Chamber Ambassadors"}</body>
