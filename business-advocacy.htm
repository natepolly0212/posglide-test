        <h1>Business Advocacy</h1>
        <p>While our Chamber members enjoy unparalleled access to networking, advertising, promotional and educational opportunities, they also benefit from
            our Chamber’s business friendly oversight at the local, state and federal levels.</p>
        <p>The primary purpose of the Business Advocacy Committee is to promote a healthy business environment in Lexington by supporting legislation and
            other governmental action which encourages a strong business climate along with growing economic opportunities.</p>
        <p>Dedicated committee members monitor issues and decisions at the different governmental levels for appropriate action by our Chamber leadership.
            We as a Chamber firmly believe interaction with and dialogue between business and government officials will develop stronger relations in our
            mutual goals of community development and economic prosperity.</p>
